  I'd like to build dynamic online communities, especially surrounding programming. Making a software project into something like a "space" -- one that many people can hang out in, visit, leave, or come back to -- is my vague goal. Software needs to be better humanized: we shouldn't rely on a development process that just outputs some chunk of code as text, but instead insist that it fairly documents the work of the people that went into it, and actively enables others to learn what is needed to add their contribution.

  People can immediately understand the output of a search algorithm. Given a visual layout, for instance, they see that it satisfies the constraints (objects don't overlap, related things are near each other, etc...) but don't care how it came about. Understanding how to deterministically generate layouts is still hard, but a given result is easy to verify.

  Small computer (raspberry pi?) with camera could be the right hardware for pen-and-paper programming. Use math parser, adding in relations for spacial layout (a^b is "b above-right a"). Use logical judgments from parser to inform OCR/layout inference? Align time series images of a single page to show the changes incrementally; with a white board, could present a history tree.
