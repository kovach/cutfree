    I'd like to build dynamic online communities, especially surrounding programming. Making a software project into something like a "space" -- one that many people can hang out in, visit, leave, or come back to -- is my vague goal. Software needs to be better humanized: we shouldn't rely on a development process that just outputs some chunk of code as text, but instead insist that it fairly documents the work of the people that went into it, and actively enables others to learn what is needed to add their contribution.
